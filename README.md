# Workshop 08 - Smart Pointers

In this workshop, we merged two lists and used a smart pointer to ensure that memory is deallocated in the event of an exception.

w8.cpp and Utilities.h was provided to us by our professor to test our code
Element.h, List.h, and Utilities.cpp was provided to us partially implemented.
We had to implement the remaining functions ourselves.

These workshops are course work from OOP345 Fall 2018 at Seneca College.
